"service 1" is a white-box service
"storage 1" is a white-box storage

"threat 1" is a high impact, high probability threat
"threat 2" is a medium impact, medium probability threat

"measure 1" is a partial measure against "threat 1"
"measure 2" is a full measure against "threat 1"

"alias 1" is "service 1"

"element group" is "service 1", "storage 1"
"threat group" is "threat 1", "threat 2"
"data group" is "data 1", "data 2"
"invalid group" is "service 1", "threat 1"

"agent 1" sends "data group" to "element group", risking "threat group"
